Task:
Build a simple shopping list app in Kotlin within one hour.
 
Requirements:
Display a list of shopping items with:
An icon 
An aisle number 
Allow users to strike through an item once it has been added to the cart. 
Implement sorting: 
Alphabetically 
By aisle number 
If possible, make the sorting feel magical, like a Harry Potter spell (this is a fun bonus!). 
Keep it a single-page applicationâ€”just the shopping list. 
 
Submission Guidelines:
Please spend one hour on the development, and then send us:
A video recording demonstrating the app. 
The code repository (GitHub, ZIP file, or any other format). 
The APK file for testing. 
 
Example inspiration: Listtonic (https://app.listonic.com/en), but feel free to implement your own approach.
